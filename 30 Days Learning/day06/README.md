# Day 6: Controller-Runtime Framework

## 🎯 Goal
Understand how controller-runtime builds on client-go to provide high-level abstractions for operator development, focusing on reading and understanding existing patterns.

## 📚 Study Materials

### Core Study Guide
- **`day6_complete_guide.md`** - Complete 45-minute study guide covering:
  - Controller-runtime architecture and benefits
  - Manager pattern and lifecycle management
  - How ODH operator uses controller-runtime
  - Builder pattern for controller setup
  - Understanding reconciliation flow

### Light Analysis Exercises
- **`day6_exercises.md`** - Code reading and pattern analysis (15 minutes)
- Focus on understanding controller setup and reconciler patterns

## ⏰ Time Allocation
